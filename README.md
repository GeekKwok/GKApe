# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

A smart contract named GKApe(GKAPE) NFT, which is an ERC721 NFT, is included in this project. The contract is deployed to the Sepolia testnet and can be viewed on Etherscan.
